## Restaurant Reviews: Stage 3

Added a form to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, the form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. The site id optimized to meet even stricter performance benchmarks than the previous project.



### Setup

Setup [Node development server](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3) accoriding to a README file. Once you have the server up, you can do the following steps:
* `git clone https://github.com/mradenovic/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git`
* `cd mws-restaurant-stage-1`
* `npm install`
* `gulp serve`
